# Year 12 Python Exercises

This is where all the Python exercises I make in Year 12 Computer Science will go, each explained in their own section below.

## Classes Exercises

Exercises where we're using classes.

### pet.py

A pet simulator. All you can do so far is feed your pet, and it doesn't have a particular species.

### student_manager.py

Shows a window with 2 students (me and Ken), and has a show grade buttons. It only shows my grade, an Excellence.

## GUI

Projects using a GUI (notable because this is the first year I've done GUIs). I think they'll all be using Tkinter.

### background.py

Brings up a window with two buttons. One says "Red." and the other says "Blue." and you click one to change the background to the respective colour.

### button_clicker.py

Baby's first Python GUI using Tkinter. It's pretty simple, you just click the button in the window that comes up, but with a sinister twist...

### quiz.py

A GUI quiz about New Zealand road rules. Learning both GUI and classes.

## Maths

Projects related to maths (duh). I think they'll mostly be problems from [Project Euler](projecteuler.net/archives).

### multiples.py

Problem 1 on Project Euler. It finds the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000.

## Other files

Not projects, just for organisational purposes.

### hello.txt

We were learning how to use Git.

### README.md

This file.
