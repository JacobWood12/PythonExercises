# Year 12 Python Exercises.
This is where all the Python exercises I make in Year 12 Computer Science will go, each explained in their own section below.
## GUI.
Projects using a GUI (notable because this is the first year I've done GUIs). I think they'll all be using Tkinter.
### Button Clicker.
Baby's first Python GUI using TKinter. It's pretty simple, you just click the button in the window that comes up, but with a sinister twist...
## Maths.
Projects related to maths (duh). I think they'll mostly be problems from [Project Euler](projecteuler.net/archives), and maybe the NZIO (I think that's what it's called?).
### multiples.py
Problem 1 on Project Euler. It finds the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000.
## hello.txt.
We were learning how to use Git.
## pet.py
A pet simulator. All you can do so far is feed your pet, and it doesn't have a particular species.
## README.md
