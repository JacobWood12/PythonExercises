# Year 12 Python Exercises

This is where all the Python exercises I make in Year 12 Computer Science will go, each explained in their own section below.

## Classes Exercises

Exercises where we're using classes.

### pet.py

A pet simulator. All you can do so far is feed your pet, and it doesn't have a particular species.

### student_manager.py

Shows a window with 2 students (me and Ken), and has a show grade buttons. It only shows my grade, an Excellence.

## GUI

Projects using a GUI (notable because this is the first year I've done GUIs). I think they'll all be using Tkinter.

### House

> [!NOTE]
> If you're copying this folder to your own device, make sure to go into house.py and change the filepath of house.jpeg to wherever the file is on your system. The current filepath will only work on my computer and I don't know how to use relative links.

Brings up a purple window. It has the title "House" and a picture of a house, which is a button that does nothing.

It's a folder because there are multiple files related to it (as per below).

This project is code that I copied then "improved" from Mrs Chavez. If you want to see the version before cleaning up, switch to the `house` branch and go to commit `6a6893d (Started house.py.)`

</details>

#### House example code.jpeg

A picture (used in the pull-down menu below) of the original code on the projector from my seat in the middle of class. It's mostly readable.

#### house.png

A clip-art picture of a house on a light grey background that is used as a button in this program.

#### house.py

The program itself. Does what is described in the section above.

### True or False

> [!NOTE]
> This program will ask for a **username** and **password** upon opening. The username is `Jacob` and the password is `TakahÄ“1848?!`.

A game for us to study, copied from [level-2-programming-assessment-mrs-chavez](https://github.com/MRGS-Computer-Scientist/level-2-programming-assessment-mrs-chavez/tree/main), which I then "improved".

Answer 8 different True or False questions about animals.

#### login.py

Contains the login screen and process.

#### main.py

**Run this file.**  It starts the program.

#### mainmenu.py

Contains the main menu where you can choose to play or exit.

#### true_or_false_questions.py

Contains a dictionary of all the questions and their answers.

#### trueorfalse.py

Contains the code for the game itself.

### background.py

Brings up a window with two buttons. One says "Red." and the other says "Blue." and you click one to change the background to the respective colour.

### button_clicker.py

Baby's first Python GUI using Tkinter. It's pretty simple, you just click the button in the window that comes up, but with a sinister twist...

### compass.py

A window with north, south, east and west buttons around the edge and a label in the middle which says the most recently pressed direction.

It was for learning layout management.

### messageboxes.py

I made this because I saw messageboxes in another program and wanted to experiment with them. I think it has them all.

### pride_conversation.py

An app for Pride Week that asks the user if they know the meaning of various words used by the Rainbow community.

This project is [code that I copied](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1niZqEklBdgea0ILwd2vFiKsP474_K9Qp/view) then "improved" up from Mrs Chavez. If you want to see the version before cleaning up, switch to the `prideconversation` branch and go to commit `c1158be (Copied pride_conversation.py from second section of video - Creating and navigating to screens.`

### quiz.py

A GUI quiz about New Zealand road rules. Learning both GUI and classes.

## Maths

Projects related to maths (duh). I think they'll mostly be problems from [Project Euler](projecteuler.net/archives).

### multiples.py

Problem 1 on Project Euler. It finds the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000.

## Other files

Not projects, just for organisational purposes.

### .gitignore

Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. I just used the GitHub template for Python.

### README.md

This file.

### hello.txt

We were learning how to use Git.
